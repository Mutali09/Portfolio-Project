QuizWhiz MVP Specification.
Architecture
My web app is a single-page app, coded mainly in JavaScript. QuizWhiz is front-end heavy. It is a simple, easy to use, and fun app. Most of the User Interface will be designed using plain CSS and HTML to structure web pages.
I have decided to learn more about React.js framework which I will for front-end development. React.js is known for its simplicity, reusability, and performance optimizations, making it a popular choice for frontend development. I will use React.js to create reusable UI components for displaying quiz questions, options, results, and interactive elements.
Frontend Components:
Quiz Component: The main component responsible for rendering the quiz interface. It includes sub-components for displaying questions, options, and handling user interactions.
Question Component: A reusable component for rendering individual quiz questions. It receives question data as props and displays the question text.
Options Component: A component for rendering multiple-choice options for each question. It receives options data as props and handles user selection.
Results Component: A component for displaying quiz results, including the user's score and feedback. It receives results data as props and displays them in a visually appealing manner.
Navigation Component: A component for navigating between quiz questions and managing quiz progress.
