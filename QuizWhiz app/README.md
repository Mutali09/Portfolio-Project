QuizWhiz App
This is my QuizWhiz app which I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. For the database, I used Trivia
The project is deployed at https://mutali09.github.io/Portfolio-Project/

Usage of the app

    Select a category for the quiz from the available options.
    Click the "Play" button to start the quiz.
    Read the questions and select the correct answer.
    Instant feedback will be provided after each answer.
    Continue answering questions until you reach the end of the quiz.
    At the end of the quiz, you will be presented with your score and the option to restart or choose a different category.
